# Cliqstr Plans

All plans include **AI moderation** and **2 free parent accounts** for safety oversight.

> We know most social media sites are “free.” They’re free because they sell information about you and your child and use algorithms to manipulate users. Cliqstr is different. We never sell data or run ads. Our subscription fees cover the real costs of moderation and safety features that other sites simply don’t provide.
